The FFXII Job Randomizer is used to roll a random set of jobs, characters, and usable weaponry for a playthrough of Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age. You can choose multiple rules by which to roll and play. After rolling you are able to save your setup so you can load it again if you plan to play through in multiple sessions. You are also able to choose either a light and dark themes, as well as a horizontal and vertical layouts.

Rolling rules are as follows:
1. Unique Jobs - The same job will never be rolled twice.
2. Weapon Locked - This will roll a usable weapon from the jobs that are given. You must switch to the weapon type once they become available to you. A link to the wiki is provided so you will know where and when to switch for the less common weapons.
3. Classic - Inspired by Classic from four job fiesta, this will only roll you main jobs from the 6 jobs of the original Final Fantasy (or their equivalents). These include Knight, Monk, Shikari(thief), White Mage, Black Mage, and Red Battlemage.
4. Main Only - Toggling this setting will prevent subjobs from being rolled.
5. Random Characters - This setting will roll character assignments along with jobs. These 3 characters must be used. All other characters can be used leading up to recruiting later characters, in order to fill empty slots, but they may not have jobs assigned and must be treated similarly to Guests.
